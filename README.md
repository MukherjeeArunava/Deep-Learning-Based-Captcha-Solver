# Deep-Learning-Based-Captcha-Solver
LSTM based CAPTCHA breaker for Vulnerability Assessment project breaks all types of numerical CAPTCHAS

A novel CNN model built on LSTM technology is being developed to aid in the process. By demonstrating that text-based CAPTCHAs are becoming increasingly challenging for people to solve, while attackers continue to develop more potent CAPTCHA breakers every single day, this effort exposes the weakness of the CAPTCHA system.

The effectiveness of the current system in deciphering CAPTCHAs using noises is quite low, hence an LSTM network is employed to solve this problem. This problem is solved by LSTM networks because they enable the network to learn from long-term dependencies. This is accomplished by adding four interconnected neural network layers in place of the single neural network layer present in an unstacked RNN. Thus, a novel neural network technique that incorporates stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) is created with the goal of more effectively cracking CAPTCHAs that contain noise like lines and dots.
